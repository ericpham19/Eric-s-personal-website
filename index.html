                <P> I began my coding journey by getting familiar with the concept and usage of "Command Line Interface ". My next lesson was an essential language called HTML. By learning HTML, I was able to create basic structure for a website. Further enhancing my learning, I stumbled across CSS which equipped me with the skills to modify the contents of my page. I look forward to learning more exciting languages and concepts in the upcoming weeks </P>
